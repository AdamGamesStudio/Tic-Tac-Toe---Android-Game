To play the game, you have to install in on your phone. This app works only on android devices, and there is two ways to try it.

### **1st method** - Google play

The game is published on Google Play, so you can safely download it. Just click [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adamgamesstudio.tictactoegame) link!

### **2nd method** - manual installation (from apk file)

This method is a little harder. Just follow these steps:

 - Download the version of the app you like to your phone. To do this, you will have to open the repository on phone, and navigate to *.TicTacToeGame/builds/FINAL ABBs* folder and chose a release. Then *View raw* and seva the file.
 - Open the file that you downloaded, and install the game.

It's that easy! If you have any problems with it, check [this](https://www.nextpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file) site.
